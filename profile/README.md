## COVID Violation Detection Assistance System (VDAS)

**Full Project Name:** AI-integrated Surveillance System to Support Detecting Social Distancing & Face Mask Violations  

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Introduction 
 
  
**COVID Violation Detection Assistance System** (VDAS) aims to utilize Deep Learning to help authorities and organizations to easier manage, delineate pre-defined areas with the most COVID-19 violations (social distancing and face mask), and take preemptive actions.  

VDAS provides the management capabilities for roles, cameras, areas, managers, staff, as well as the capabilities to detect face mask and social distancing violations, and generates relevant reports.

VDAS makes use of the [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) object detection model, with specific focus on dealing with complex conditions (low-light conditions, crowded areas). The final product consists of 2 major parts: A trained YOLOv5 model, and the web application.

**VDAS Features**  
-  Detect face mask/social distancing violations from image/video/camera stream
-  Manage Areas, Cameras, Roles, Managers, Staff
-  Export violation rate/specific violation case report
